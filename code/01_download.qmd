- We can downlaod the data from [https://zenodo.org/records/3371216](https://zenodo.org/records/3371216)

```{python}
import requests
from pathlib import Path
import tarfile

data_tar = Path("..") / "data.tar.gz"
data_directory = Path("..") / "data"

if data_directory.exists():
    print(f"Data directory already exists at {data_directory}.")
elif data_tar.exists():
    print(f"Tar.gz file found at {data_tar}. Extracting...")
    with tarfile.open(data_tar, "r:gz") as tar_ref:
        tar_ref.extractall(data_directory)
    print("Extraction complete.")
    # Delete the tar file
    data_tar.unlink()
    print(f"Deleted tar.gz file at {data_tar}.")
else:
    data_url = "https://zenodo.org/records/3371216/files/data.tar.gz?download=1"
    response = requests.get(data_url, stream=True)
    response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an error for bad HT
    with open(data_tar, "wb") as file:
        for chunk in response.iter_content(chunk_size=8192):
            file.write(chunk)
    print(f"Downloaded and saved tar.gz file at {data_tar}.")
    print("Extracting the tar.gz file...")
    with tarfile.open(data_tar, "r:gz") as tar_ref:
        tar_ref.extractall(data_directory)
    print("Extraction complete.")
    data_tar.unlink()
    print(f"Deleted tar.gz file at {data_tar}.")
list(data_directory.iterdir())
```

- Since the data directory is quite large we will delete the files we don't need.

```{python}

```

- Furthermore we download the `mm10.fa` file

```{python}
mm10_file = data_directory / "mm10.fa.gz"
mm10_url = "https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm10/bigZips/mm10.fa.gz"
# Check if the file already exists
if mm10_file.exists():
    print(f"File already exists at {mm10_file}. Skipping download.")
else:
    # Download the file
    print(f"Downloading {mm10_url}...")
    response = requests.get(mm10_url, stream=True)
    response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an error for bad HTTP responses

    # Save the file
    with open(mm10_file, "wb") as file:
        for chunk in response.iter_content(chunk_size=8192):
            file.write(chunk)
    print(f"Downloaded and saved file at {mm10_file}.")
